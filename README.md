# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project implements advanced machine learning techniques to analyze sentiment in Twitter data. Using the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million annotated tweets, the project aims to classify sentiments into positive, neutral, and negative categories.

## Project Objectives
- Develop and refine multiple machine learning models for sentiment classification
- Compare performance of different models to identify the most effective approaches
- Optimize models to achieve high accuracy in sentiment prediction


## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
   - Text normalization (lowercasing, noise removal)
   - Tokenization
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering

2. Model Building and Training
   - Models implemented:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Naive Bayes (Complement, Multinomial, Bernoulli)
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forests
     - Gradient Boosting
     - Neural Networks (Multi-Layer Perceptrons)

3. Model Evaluation
   - Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix analysis

4. Hyperparameter Tuning
   - Techniques: Grid Search CV, Random Search CV, Bayesian Optimization

5. Visualization
   - Data distribution visualizations
   - Model performance comparisons
   - ROC curves and AUC scores

## Key Findings
- Detailed performance comparisons between different models
- Insights into model strengths and weaknesses for sentiment classification
